# EE236: Devices Lab - Experiments and Reports

**Department of Electrical Engineering**  
Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay

This repository contains experiment handouts and lab reports for the **EE236: Electronic Devices Lab** course. Each experiment covers specific characteristics and properties of semiconductor devices, providing both theoretical insights and practical implementations. *Note: Excel files with raw data/results are not included here to encourage hands-on experimentation and learning.*

> ⚠️ **Reminder:** It may be tempting to just use these reports, but performing these experiments yourself builds a unique level of understanding and confidence. Debugging circuits and working through the details will significantly aid in mastering concepts in this and other courses.
